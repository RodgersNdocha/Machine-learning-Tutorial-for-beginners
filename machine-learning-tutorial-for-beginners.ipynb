Basic tools: like python, R, or sql. You do not need to know everythin. what you only need is to learn how to use python.\n2. Basic statistics: like mean median, or standard deviation, if you noe basic statistics, you can use python easily.\n3. Data Munging: working with messy and difficulty data.like a inconsistence data ad string formatting. As you guess, python helps us.\n4. data visualizations: Title is actually explanatory. we will visualize the sata with python like matplot and seaborn\n5. Machine learning: you do not need to understand math behind the machine learning learning techniques.you noly need to understand basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using python.\nAs a summary we will learn python to be data scientist !!!\nFor parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, look at DATA SCIENCE TUTORIAL for BEGINNERS\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners/\n\nIn this tutorial, I am not going to learn machine learning to you, I am going to explain how to learn something by yourself.\nConfucius: Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.

MACHINE LEARNING (ML)**\nIn python there are some ML libraries like sklearn, keras or tensorflow. We will use sklearn.\n\n**A. SUPERVISED LEARNING**\nSupervised learning: It uses data that has labels. Example, there are orthopedic patients data that have labels normal and abnormal.\nThere are features(predictor variable) and target variable. Features are like pelvic radius or sacral slope(If you have no idea what these are like me, you can look images in google like what I did :) )Target variables are labels normal and abnormal\nAim is that as given features(input) predict whether target variable(output) is normal or abnormal\nClassification: target variable consists of categories like normal or abnormal\nRegression: target variable is continious like stock market\nIf these explanations are not enough for you, just google them. However, be careful about terminology: features = predictor variable = independent variable = columns = inputs. target variable = responce variable = class = dependent variable = output = result\n\n\n**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**\nIn order to make something in data, as you know you need to explore data. Detailed exploratory data analysis is in my Data Science Tutorial for Beginners\nI always start with head() to see features that are pelvic_incidence, pelvic_tilt numeric, lumbar_lordosis_angle, sacral_slope, pelvic_radius and degree_spondylolisthesis and target variable that is class\nhead(): default value of it shows first 5 rows(samples). If you want to see for example 100 rows just write head(100)\n","metadata":{}}]}
